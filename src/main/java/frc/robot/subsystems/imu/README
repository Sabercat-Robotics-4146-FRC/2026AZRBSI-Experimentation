The hardware-specific IO files included here are a baseline for what we expect
teams to use.  If, however, you are using a different combination of hardware,
you will need to create a new ``GyroIO*.java`` file.  We encourage you to
submit a PR to the Az-RBSI repositiory with your new hardware file if you feel
other teams may benefit from its inclusion.

Existing IO files:

  - ``GyroIOPigeon2.java``: CTRE Pigeon2 as the swerve IMU
  - ``GyroIONavX.java``: NavX as the swerve IMU, connected via SPI
