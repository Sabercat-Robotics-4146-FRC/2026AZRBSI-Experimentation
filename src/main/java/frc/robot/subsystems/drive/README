The hardware-specific IO files included here are a baseline for what we expect
teams to use.  If, however, you are using a different combination of hardware,
you will need to create a new ``ModuleIO*.java`` file.  We encourage you to
submit a PR to the Az-RBSI repositiory with your new hardware file if you feel
other teams may benefit from its inclusion.  Additionally, the instantiation
logic in ``Drive.java`` will need to be extended to include the new module
type.

Existing IO files:

  - ``ModuleIOTalonFX.java``: 2x TalonFX motors + CANcoder
  - ``ModuleIOTalonFXS.java``: 2x TalonFXS motors + CANcoder
  - ``ModuleIOSpark.java``: 2x Rev NEO motors + analog absolute encoder connected to the RIO
  - ``ModuleIOSparkCANcoder.java``: 2x Rv NEO motors + CANcoder
  - ``ModuleIOBlended.java``: TalonFX drive, Rev NEO steer motors + CANcoder
